## Cooperation Plan
- All team members have variety of abilities and skills, but these are the key strengths for each (Enthusiasm, Creativity, Patience ,Teamwork).

- A team member who is good at "communicating" is always helpful in connecting the dots to a final result with the help of a" detail oriented " member to help him/her to connect the dots correctly. As every team member is unique in one strength but all members should know and understand the full aspects of the project in which case a daily meeting with all the team members should be held to follow up and check on the progress of the project.
